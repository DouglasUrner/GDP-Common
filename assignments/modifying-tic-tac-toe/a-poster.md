As a group, create a poster to share your ideas for modifying Tic-Tac-Toe. The poster can be:

* A description of the modified game, or
* A description of a mechanic that you are exploring.

After completing the poster:

1. Ensure that the name(s) of the members of your group and the block your class meets are visible on the front.
1. Hang the poster in the 202 common area.

Then, use sticky notes to leave feedback on the other posters. Leave either:

* Positive, **constructive** feedback - “Your examples were clear and easy to understand.” Or
* A clarifying question - “Could you explain more about how this mechanic works, I didn’t understand…”

Leave _at least_ two notes.
