You will submit two items: your notes, and the playtest reports which will be collected and passed along to the game designers.

### Notes:

1. Place a sticky note bookmark on the long edge of the first page of today's notes.
1. Make sure there are no loose pages.
1. Return your notebook to your hanging folder at the end of class.

### Playtest Reports:

You should be submitting a **minimum of three** reports.

1. Be sure your name is on **each** report.
1. Be sure each report clearly (and unambiguously) identifies the game & designers.
1. Keep the reports stapled together.
1. Place them in the inbox on the low table by the classroom door at the end of class.
