The **Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics** (MDA) framework was one of the first attempts to develop a theory of game design.

We will practice on the classic version of Tic-Tac-Toe and then you will create an MDA chart for your modified version of Tic-Tac-Toe using the [template][].

## Notes

* MDA concepts
  - Definitions
  - What designers can do
  - What players experience
* Practice with "classic Tic-Tic-Toe" in class.

## Instructions

Use the [template][] to create an MDA chart showing how you modified your new version of Tic-Tac-Toe.

* Use the first row of the chart to define *mechanics, dynamics,* and *aesthetics* in your own words. Add examples from games (both physical and electronic) that you know.
* Then fill out the MDA columns for "classic" Tic-Tac-Toe.
* Next make an "MDA based" proposal for fixing Tic-Tac-Toe, work from right to left:
  - What do you want to fix about the *aesthetics* of Tic-Tac-Toe (and what do you want to preserve)?
  - How will the *dynamics* of the game need to change to support the aesthetics that you want?
  - Ideas for *mechanics* that (you hope) will accomplish your goals.
* Format additions in **bold**.
* Format deletions as <del>strike outs</del> (**Alt-Shift-5** or **Format > Text > Strikethrough**) through the elements that you are eliminating.

Submit the document as usual.
